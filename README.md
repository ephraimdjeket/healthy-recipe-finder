## About the project

This is my solution for the recipe finder website challenge on Frontend Mentor.

The challenge was to build a responsive recipe finder with search, filtering and dynamic content. This challenged allowed me to practice working with JSON data, handling complex layout that must fit mobile, tablet and desktop and interactive Javascript features.

## Built with

For this project I used:

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS Custom Variables
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-First Workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

## Useful resources

- **Figma** - I used Figma to check the sizes and colors of different elements.
